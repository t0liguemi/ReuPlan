# ReuPlan

Very simple app to create meetings without having to check everybody's availability. The invitees will just input their availabilities and the calendar will show you when is it, that all participants can attend your meeting

Here is a small demo

remember to add the .env with SUPER_SECRET_KEY and PASS_KEY in the backend
as well as .env with your google api key

EDIT: I am currently porting this to django for deployment, you can see the other version in my repos  :)
